# [TADNet] Unravel Anomalies: An End-to-End Seasonal-Trend Decomposition Approach for Time Series Anomaly Detection

This repository This repository contains the code for the paper "[Unravel Anomalies: An End-to-End Seasonal-Trend Decomposition Approach for Time Series Anomaly Detection](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10446482)" by *Zhenwei Zhang; Ruiqi Wang; Ran Ding; Yuantao Gu*, published in the IEEE ICASSP 2024 (International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing).

## Introduction

:triangular_flag_on_post: Presentation Slides for this paper can be found on [IEEE SigPort](https://sigport.org/documents/unravel-anomalies-end-end-seasonal-trend-decomposition-approach-time-series-anomaly) ([Download](https://sigport.org/sites/default/files/docs/TADNet%20Oral.pdf)). 

> Traditional Time-series Anomaly Detection (TAD) methods often struggle with the composite nature of complex time-series data and a diverse array of anomalies. We introduce TADNet, an end-to-end TAD model that leverages Seasonal-Trend Decomposition to link various types of anomalies to specific decomposition components, thereby simplifying the analysis of complex time-series and enhancing detection performance. Our training methodology, which includes pre-training on a synthetic dataset followed by fine-tuning, strikes a balance between effective decomposition and precise anomaly detection. Experimental validation on real-world datasets confirms TADNetâ€™s state-of-the-art performance across a diverse range of anomalies.
